Based on the given table, I would suggest the following normalization 
steps:

Create a new table to store information about airports:
Airports table:

AirportID (primary key)
AirportSeqID
CityMarketID
CityName
State
StateFips
StateName
Wac

Create a new table to store information about airlines:
Airlines table:

AirlineID (primary key)
Name
DOT_ID

Create a new table to store information about flights:
Flights table:

FlightID (primary key)
FlightDate
AirlineID (foreign key referencing Airlines)
OriginAirportID (foreign key referencing Airports)
DestAirportID (foreign key referencing Airports)
Cancelled

Create a new table to store information about code share partnerships:
CodeSharePartners table:

AirlineID (foreign key referencing Airlines)
MarketingAirlineID (foreign key referencing Airlines)
DOT_ID_Marketing_Airline
IATA_Code_Marketing_Airline

Create a new table to store information about flight delays:
FlightDelays table:

FlightID (foreign key referencing Flights)
DelayType (e.g. "departure", "arrival")
DelayMinutes
DelayGroups

Create a new table to store information about flight times:
FlightTimes table:

FlightID (foreign key referencing Flights)
DepTimeBlk
ArrTimeBlk
DistanceGroup

Create a new table to store information about airport operations:
AirportOperations table:

AirportID (foreign key referencing Airports)
TaxiOut

DivAirportLandings

With this normalization, we can reduce data redundancy and ensure data 
consistency. We can also more easily update or modify information without 
running into anomalies.
